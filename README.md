# Game Cops and Robber 

Our team named this project Cops N Robbers (CnR). CnR is a simple 2D-based computer game with the concept of Robbers who must collect as much treasure as possible. The game is declared finished when the player declares surrender or the treasure points owned have been exhausted. This game was created with the aim of fulfilling the final project of the basic python programming lecture held at the PyPro event in December 2021. Making the game starts with creating every asset needed, then proceeds with the user interface design, score algorithm, to the testing stage.
